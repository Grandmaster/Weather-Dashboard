# Weather Dashboard

The weather dashboard is an app that displays the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city you search. The site can be found here: [Weather Dashboard](https://grandmaster.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)

## Installation

This code runs in any modern browser.

## Usage

When a user navigates to the site, he is met with a search bar asking for a city to search. Upon a successful search, the page displays the current weather data and the 5-day forecast for the searched city, and saves the city to search history, which is displayed under the search bar. Upon reloading the page, the search history is restored (if it's not empty), and the last searched city is displayed on the screen. The site alerts the user if a city search is invalid.

## Demonstration
